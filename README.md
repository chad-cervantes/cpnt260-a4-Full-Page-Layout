### Above and Beyond

- I created a social navigation bar inside the footer element; see lines 57-61 in index.html

### Important Notes

- AA contrast: The text color of the paragraph, for some odd reason, has a low contrast ratio; but text can be seen very clearly. The inspector states that because I have a white background, the color of the test is hard to see, but this isn't the case since I used a gradient of three different colors.
